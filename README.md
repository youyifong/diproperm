# diproperm

DiProPerm is a hypotheis test for the significance of pre-defined classes in high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) data. It is currently archived by CRAN due to depenency issue. Here I provide a usuable version. All credit should be attributed to the original authors of the package:

Andrew G. Allmon and J.S. Marron and Michael G. Hudgens (2021). diproperm: An R Package for the DiProPerm Test. The R Journal.



*The following is readme page of the original diproperm package*

diproperm is an R package for conducting a direction-projection-permutation test (DiProPerm).  
This package is available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/diproperm/index.html) and has been tested on Windows, MacOS, and Fedora Linux machines.

Note: Some users have experienced an issue where the R package 'gert' needs to be installed before installing the github version of diproperm. 

Note: Some users have also reported no computational gain after using 10 cores.

v 0.2.0 adds the functionality of SVM to the package as well as improved documentation and improved error handling 



## Youyi

0.3.1 introduces two bug fixes:
1. Fixed a bug in the permutation statistics calculation 
2. Fixed a bug in the SVM implementation
